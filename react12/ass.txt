Ques: useContext vs Redux ?
Ans: In useContext , we made context for different variables or states so it will be more complex 
     when our app scales up.
     So , for that we introduced redux in which we have made a global store from which we handle 
     all states using reducers , slices , dispatchers and selectors.

Ques: Advantage of using Redux Toolkit over Redux.
Ans:  Little complex in initial/Configure_Stage stage, later it will smoothly work.
     1. Easy to configure
     2. less packages
     3. less code

Ques: Explain Dispatcher ?
Ans: When we want to interact with store we have to call a reducer function which will be 
     called by a some button in any of the components , so this event will dispatches an action 
     which will be associated to specific reducer function and it will do it's own job.

Ques: Explain Reducer
Ans:  Reducer is just a normal function which consist of different actions which are to 
      be called by some dispatchers.


Ques: Explain Slice
Ans:  Slice is s piece pf Redux Store. Slice is just a global state of any variable which can be 
      accessed by all the components of whole app.    

Ques: Explain selector ?
Ans: When we want to read a state from store we use a hook called useSelector which allows to 
     read any state from store.        


import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const randomSlice = createSlice({
  name: "Random",
  initialState: {
    // Any initial value or state or variable you want
    anyState: [],
  },
  reducers: {
    // Define actions or reducer functions here
    addItem: (state, actions) => {
      // Code your logic here
    },
  },
});

export const { addItem } = randomSlice.actions;
export default randomSlice.reducer;
